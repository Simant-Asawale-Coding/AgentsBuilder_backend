# Agents Studio: Agent Features & Capabilities Documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to Agents Studio! Our platform empowers you to create, deploy, and manage next-generation AI agents that are interoperable, extensible, and ready for real-world impact. This documentation provides an overview of the features and benefits you receive as an end user of our A2A (Agent-to-Agent) agents, powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and a diverse set of agent frameworks.

## What Are A2A Agents?
A2A (Agent-to-Agent) agents are designed for seamless communication and collaboration—not just with users, but with other agents and tools. Built on Google’s open A2A protocol, these agents can:
- Discover and interact with other agents across platforms and vendors
- Advertise and consume capabilities using standardized "Agent Cards"
- Exchange structured messages, data, and context securely
- Collaborate on tasks, delegate responsibilities, and share results

This enables you to build powerful, interconnected solutions where agents work together to solve complex problems, automate processes, and deliver rich user experiences.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tools
Our agents are equipped with MCP tools, which provide standardized, secure, and scalable access to a wide range of external data sources, business systems, and APIs. With MCP, your agents can:
- Connect to databases, content repositories, cloud platforms, and enterprise tools
- Retrieve, update, and act on real-time data from multiple sources
- Leverage pre-built connectors for platforms like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Postgres, and more
- Maintain context as they interact with different systems, ensuring smarter and more relevant actions

MCP makes your agents truly context-aware, unlocking automation and intelligence across your digital ecosystem.
