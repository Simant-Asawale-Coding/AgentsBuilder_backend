# Dynamic Agent Builder – Implementation Plan & Checklist

## 1. Project Preparation
- [ ] Review and finalize architecture documentation ([architecture.md](architecture.md))
- [ ] Set up project repository structure
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for backend and agent deployment

---

## 2. Templates & Schemas
- [ ] Ensure each framework directory has:
    - [ ] Jinja2 code template (e.g., `openai_agents.py.j2`)
    - [ ] Credential schema (`creds_schema.json`)
- [ ] Validate templates for correct variable slots and logic
- [ ] Validate schemas for all required fields

---

## 3. Backend Implementation
- [ ] Implement tool registry and `GET /tools` endpoint
- [ ] Implement framework registry and `GET /frameworks` endpoint
- [ ] Implement agent creation endpoint (`POST /agents`):
    - [ ] Validate tool selection
    - [ ] Validate credentials against schema
    - [ ] Render Jinja2 template with user input
    - [ ] Deploy agent (local/Docker/Azure)
    - [ ] Register agent (ID, status, endpoint)
- [ ] Implement agent lifecycle endpoints:
    - [ ] `GET /agents/{id}/status`
    - [ ] `GET /agents/{id}/endpoint`
    - [ ] `POST /agents/{id}/query`
    - [ ] `GET /agents/{id}/tools`
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging throughout

---

## 4. Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Design and implement UI wireframes
- [ ] Implement tool palette (fetches from `/tools`)
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop agent builder
- [ ] Implement agent configuration modal:
    - [ ] Dynamic credential fields (from `/frameworks`/schema)
    - [ ] Framework selector
    - [ ] System prompt input
- [ ] Implement deployment status and chat UI
- [ ] Implement tool visualization (tiles/icons)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint retrieval and copy-to-clipboard
- [ ] Implement error/success notifications

---

## 5. Integration & Testing
- [ ] End-to-end test: Create agent, deploy, chat, retrieve endpoint
- [ ] Validate credential handling (no leaks in UI or logs)
- [ ] Validate agent registry and lifecycle management
- [ ] Validate template rendering for all frameworks
- [ ] Test adding new tool/framework (extensibility)

---

## 6. Documentation
- [ ] Document API contracts and usage
- [ ] Document template and schema structure
- [ ] User guide for agent builder UI
- [ ] Developer guide for adding new frameworks/tools
- [ ] Troubleshooting and FAQ

---

## 7. Review & QA
- [ ] Review all checklist items for duplicacy and overlap
- [ ] Cross-reference architecture doc for missing or redundant tasks
- [ ] Peer review of code and documentation
- [ ] Final QA pass and bugfix

---

## 8. Launch
- [ ] Prepare for production deployment
- [ ] Announce and onboard users
- [ ] Monitor usage and collect feedback

---

# Relationships & Duplicacy Notes
- **Templates & Schemas:** Each used by both backend (codegen/validation) and UI (dynamic fields)—no duplicacy.
- **Tool/Framework Registry:** Centralized, used by both UI and backend.
- **API endpoints:** Each endpoint has a unique, non-overlapping responsibility.
- **Agent Registry:** Single source of truth for all agents, referenced by all lifecycle endpoints.
- **Credential Handling:** Unified per framework, validated and rendered in both backend and UI.
